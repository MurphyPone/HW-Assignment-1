In Catilinam - Cicero

Oh the time, Oh the Morales! The g is aware of these things; 

the consul sees them; and yet this g lives. Lives! aye, he comes even into the senate. 

He takes a part in the public deliberations;

he is watching and marking down and checking off for g every individual among us. 

And we, g men that we are, 

think that we are doing our duty to the republic if we keep out of the way of his frenzied attacks.
