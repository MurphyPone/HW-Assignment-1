In Catilinam - Cicero

Oh the time, Oh the Morales! The <noun> is aware of these things; 

the consul sees them; and yet this <noun> lives. Lives! aye, he comes even into the <place of meeting>. 

He takes a part in the public deliberations;

he is watching and marking down and checking off for <verb> every individual among us. 

And we, <adjective> men that we are, 

think that we are doing our duty to the republic if we keep out of the way of his frenzied attacks.
